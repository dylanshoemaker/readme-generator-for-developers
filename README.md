# Description

Every developer's project needs a README that highlights the nitty gritty of their application. What is this app for? How do I use this app? How do I install this app? How do I make contributions to this app? Who do I contact if I have any questions on how this app works or how to start contributing to this app? All of these questions should be answered in the README. This README generate is designed to aid developers in creating a professional readme that will help get their projects noticed.

# Usage

![walkthrough](./images/readme-generator-for-developers-walkthrough.gif)  

When you run node index.js in your terminal, you will be prompted to answer a series of questions. Once all questions are answered please navigate to the dist folder as it will house the markdown file that your responses will be stored to. Make sure to open a preview of your new README to ensure that everything is spelled correctly and that the links to your GitHub page and email are functional otherwise you will need to run the application again and reinput the correct information.
